# PrimeFactors
An experiment based on a math theory I created around 2020. This shows its viability.

Basics:
Alternate base representation provides a method to easily identify numbers for which the base is a factor.
consider in binary, all even numbers will end with a 0
in base-3, all multiples of 3 will end in 0.
this pattern continues for all possible base representations.
With appropriate preperation this can allow us to identify the prime factors of any number.

TODO:
- write a formal proof of method.
- modify the method used to populate the database to run without a provided list of primes.
- modify the population and lookup methods to utilize multi-threading for efficiency.
- improve the interface from simple cli to include file read
- possibly host the process on a (real or virtual) server with API and stuff.
